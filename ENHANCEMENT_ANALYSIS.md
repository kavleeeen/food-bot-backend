"""You are helping an Indian user choose their next meal. They're feeling decision 
fatigue and need your help. Ask: "I'd love to help you decide what to eat! First, 
do you have any dietary restrictions? Like vegetarian, vegan, or any foods you avoid?""""
```

### **3. Recommendation Format Enhancement**
```python
# Before: Basic food names
"Pasta with Marinara Sauce (Vegetarian, Italian)"

# After: Nutritional focus with benefits
"""- **Dal Chawal** (North Indian, Vegetarian) - Lentil soup served with rice.
    - Why it's good: A classic, comforting, and complete protein source when 
      lentils and rice are combined. Easy to cook in a pressure cooker or pot."""
